### Meaning of Scores
* The Positive, Negative and Neutral scores represent the proportion of text that falls in these categories. This
 means our sentence was rated as 67% Positive, 33% Neutral and 0% Negative. Hence all these should add up to 1.

* The Compound score is a metric that calculates the sum of all the lexicon ratings which have been normalized between
-1(most extreme negative) and +1 (most extreme positive). In the case above, lexicon ratings for and supercool are 2.9
